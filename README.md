## Build and deployment

* Built by Jenkins and uploaded to Docker Hub on merge to master: [coco/smartlogic-notifier](https://hub.docker.com/r/coco/smartlogic-notifier/)
* CI provided by CircleCI: [smartlogic-notifier](https://circleci.com/gh/Financial-Times/smartlogic-notifier)

## Service endpoints
Endpoints are documented in [Swagger](api.yml)

Based on the following [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TeT9pM-f3Yo6oIBLyp4ZxgL8IR2y6LZU9n66yqD6DEE).


## Healthchecks
Admin endpoints are:

`/__gtg`

`/__health`

`/__build-info`

### Logging

* The application uses [logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus); the log file is initialised in [main.go](main.go).
* Logging requires an `env` app parameter, for all environments other than `local` logs are written to file.
* When running locally, logs are written to console. If you want to log locally to file, you need to pass in an env parameter that is != `local`.
* NOTE: `/__build-info` and `/__gtg` endpoints are not logged as they are called every second from varnish/vulcand and this information is not needed in logs/splunk.
